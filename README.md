# Six-Microbes-GPT2

### Independent Study in Machine Learning project

My project for this independent study is a GPT2 based domain specifc question answer system made for the Olin class Six microbes that changed the world. The class is very reading heavy, with students having to read 5 books and 40+ pieces of literature in prepration for in-class discussions and follow-on assignments. My goal was to create a web application that could answer questions from students and point them towards where they could find more information.

I have trained the models on all the readings and made it so that new readings or documents from google results can easily be added to the model's database. The model takes in a question, gives out what it believes is the answer and the context where it found it along with the name of the document it found it in.

Sometimes it does it well
